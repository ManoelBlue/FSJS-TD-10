### Additional info:
This project is the tenth part of a Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. It has two main parts:
1. Backend at the folder named api: uses Node.js, express framework, sequelize, sqlite, among other libraries to create a REST API with relational data. The created API has authentication and validation functionalities set (this part was previously build by me and can be found at the repository FSJS-TD-09);
2. Frontend at the folder named client: uses create-react-app to generate a react application, also uses react-router-dom, react-markdown, js-cookie, among other libraries to build the client side component and handle the forms and its functionalities (this part is newly created by me to add the client side of the application).
